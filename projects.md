  headline: Gro - The Gardening Robot
  content: For the senior capstone mechatronics design course [ME102B] in UC Berkeley's
    Mechanical Engineering curriculum, my team and I designed a robot that autonomously
    takes care of your plants. The robot plants seeds and waters them based on soil
    moisture readings.
