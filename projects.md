  headline: Gro - The Gardening Robot
  content: For the senior capstone mechatronics design course [ME102B] in UC Berkeley's
    Mechanical Engineering curriculum, my team and I designed a robot that autonomously
    takes care of your plants. <br><br>We designed, prototyped, and built an app-based
    automatic gardening plant bed that plants seeds and waters them based on soil
    moisture sensors. We integrated stepper motors, a pump, capacitive soil moisture
    sensors, limit switches, a Raspberry Pi, and an Arduino. Used 3D printers and
    laser cutters.

  headline: Image-Based PID Control of a Ping Pong Ball
  content: Final project for experimentation &amp; measurements course [ME103].<br><br>Performed
    tests to understand if image-based PID control of a fan could achieve descent
    of a ping pong ball to a specified height. Used camera, ball-in-tube setup, custom
    clamp and LabView.

  headline: Computing Pressure Flow Through a Human Heart
  content: Used the Finite Element Method to compute the pressure field through a
    human heart using measurements of the velocity field spanning an entire cardiac
    cycle. Used FEniCS to solve.

  headline: 'SuperConductor: Smart IoT Baton'
  content: For the introduction to electronics for the internet of things course [EE49]
    at UC Berkeley, my partner Jonathan and I created a device to help conductors
    practice without a full orchestra. <br><br>The Super Conductor is an electronic
    conductor’s baton which can manipulate the tempo of music in real-time based on
    the user’s conducting speed. It uses an ESP32 microcontroller, and MPU9250 sensor
    to collect and send data to the internet via MQTT.

  headline: 'Clima Cup: Temperature-Regulating Thermos'
  content: For the Introduction to Product Development course [ME110] at UC Berkeley,
    my team and I tackled the problem of hot drinks staying too hot in thermoses.<br><br>Our
    solution is a temperature-regulating thermos that uses pre-frozen cooling rods
    to cool a hot beverage to a drinkable temperature. We prototyped two variants
    - one that integrates into an existing thermos via a screw-on lid and a fully
    redesigned bottle.

  content: 'Worked in a team of 5 to design and fabricate a wind turbine, which included
    the rotor blades, support tower and generator housing.<br><br>The professor specified
    the following constraints: volume of material no more than 20 cubic inches, fabrication
    solely through 3D printing, and distance between the top of the platform and the
    center of the motor shaft to not exceed 16.00 +- 1/16 inch.'
