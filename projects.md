  headline: Gro - The Gardening Robot
  content: For the senior capstone mechatronics design course [ME102B] in UC Berkeley's
    Mechanical Engineering curriculum, my team and I designed a robot that autonomously
    takes care of your plants. <br><br>We designed, prototyped, and built an app-based
    automatic gardening plant bed that plants seeds and waters them based on soil
    moisture sensors. We integrated stepper motors, a pump, capacitive soil moisture
    sensors, limit switches, a Raspberry Pi, and an Arduino. Used 3D printers and
    laser cutters.

  headline: The Super Conductor
  content: For the introduction to electronics for the internet of things course [EE49]
    at UC Berkeley, my partner Jonathan and I created a device to help conductors
    practice without a full orchestra. <br><br>The Super Conductor is an electronic
    conductor’s baton which can manipulate the tempo of music in real-time based on
    the user’s conducting speed. It uses an ESP32 microcontroller, and MPU9250 sensor
    to collect and send data to the internet via MQTT.
