  headline: Momentum Speaker Series
  content: 'My twin brother Andrew and I co-created Berkeley Engineering''s 1st student
    speaker series, focused on building career momentum, after identifying a gap between
    upperclassmen who had knowledge about topics raining from internships to entrepreneurship
    to overcoming tough challenges.<br><br>Over the course of 3 years, I helped build
    a team of 10 Berkeley Engineering students and staff members that together hosted
    8 events, 55 speakers, 400 students, and expanded the program to UC Davis and
    Microsoft. I led a marketing committee of 3 engineering students. <br><br>More:
    engineering.berkeley.edu/momentum<br><br><em>The Momentum Speaker Series is a
    TED-style student speaker series designed to help Berkeley Engineering students
    gain momentum in their career searches and professional lives through advice from
    their peers. The series is made with students in mind, and based on 3 pillars:
    (1) inclusion (2) information and (3) relatability.The goal of Momentum is to
    crowdsource information from peers who have experience in certain fields and make
    that available and applicable to other students. Each event of the series brings
    six speakers together and focuses on a common theme that will help the Berkeley
    Engineering community.</em>'
