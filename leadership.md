  headline: Momentum Speaker Series
  content: 'My twin brother Andrew and I co-created Berkeley Engineering''s 1st student
    speaker series, focused on building career momentum, after identifying a gap between
    upperclassmen who had knowledge about topics raining from internships to entrepreneurship
    to overcoming tough challenges.<br><br>Over the course of 3 years, I helped build
    a team of 10 Berkeley Engineering students and staff members that together hosted
    8 events, 55 speakers, 400 students, and expanded the program to UC Davis and
    Microsoft. I led a marketing committee of 3 engineering students. <br><br>More:
    engineering.berkeley.edu/momentum<br><br><em>The Momentum Speaker Series is a
    TED-style student speaker series designed to help Berkeley Engineering students
    gain momentum in their career searches and professional lives through advice from
    their peers. The series is made with students in mind, and based on 3 pillars:
    (1) inclusion (2) information and (3) relatability.The goal of Momentum is to
    crowdsource information from peers who have experience in certain fields and make
    that available and applicable to other students. Each event of the series brings
    six speakers together and focuses on a common theme that will help the Berkeley
    Engineering community.</em>'

  headline: The Tech Twins
  content: 'I remember enrolling at UC Berkeley not understanding how my peers were
    getting jobs at these tech companies that I had previously only heard about in
    the news.<br><br>Coming from a family with no engineers and being a first-generation
    college student in the U.S., I coffee-chatted dozens upon dozens of people, completed
    four years of engineering and business education at UC Berkeley, and am now working
    full-time at Microsoft. Along the way, I interned at Microsoft (2x), Apple (1x),
    and received an internship offer from Tesla. <br><br>My twin brother Andrew and
    I are sharing what we''ve learned through this online YouTube channel to inspire
    and prepare first generation students to break into and succeed in the tech industry.<br><br>Mission:
    change lives through tech.'
