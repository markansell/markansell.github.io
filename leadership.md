  headline: Momentum Speaker Series<br><em>Co-founder</em>
  content: 'The Momentum Speaker Series is a TED-style student speaker series designed
    to help Berkeley Engineering students gain momentum in their career searches and
    professional lives through advice from their peers. The series is made with students
    in mind, and based on 3 pillars: (1) inclusion (2) information and (3) relatability.
    <br><br>The goal of Momentum is to crowdsource information from peers who have
    experience in certain fields and make that available and applicable to other students.
    Each event of the series brings six speakers together and focuses on a common
    theme that will help the Berkeley Engineering community.<br><br>Over the course
    of 3 years, I helped build a team of 10 Berkeley Engineering students and staff
    members that together hosted 8 events, 55 speakers, 400 students, and expanded
    the program to UC Davis and Microsoft. I led a marketing committee of 3 engineering
    students. <br><br>More: engineering.berkeley.edu/momentum'

  headline: The Tech Twins<br>Co-founder &amp; Content Creator
  content: 'I remember enrolling at UC Berkeley not understanding how my peers were
    getting jobs at these tech companies that I had previously only heard about in
    the news.<br><br>Coming from a family with no engineers and being a first-generation
    college student in the U.S., I coffee-chatted dozens upon dozens of people, completed
    four years of engineering and business education at UC Berkeley, and am now working
    full-time at Microsoft. Along the way, I interned at Microsoft (2x), Apple (1x),
    and received an internship offer from Tesla.<span class="Apple-converted-space">
    </span><br><br>My twin brother Andrew and I are sharing what we''ve learned through
    this online YouTube channel to inspire and prepare first generation students to
    break into and succeed in the tech industry.<br><br>Mission: change lives through
    tech. More: youtube.com/thetechtwins'
