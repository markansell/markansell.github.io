> You miss 100% of the shots that you don't take - Wayne Gretzky

![](/uploads/2020/02/06/IMG_4968 2.JPG)

Hello! I'm Mark - a recent graduate from UC Berkeley, where I pursued simultaneous degrees in mechanical engineering and business administration. I've interned at Apple (1x) and Microsoft (2x) and am currently a Program Manager for the engineering development of new Surface devices.

I grew up in Glendale, CA and attended Clark Magnet High School.
