  content: "Hello! \U0001F44B Thanks for visiting my home on the internet. <br><br>\U0001F4CD
    Seattle, WA  ⬅️  Berkeley, CA  ⬅️ Glendale, CA<br><br>I'm Mark and I'm interested
    in building solutions to some of the world's most pressing problems. I've explored
    the intersection of engineering and business at UC Berkeley, hardware product
    development at Apple and Microsoft, and public speaking through a TEDx talk.<br><br>I'm
    interested in innovative hardware product development because, when I was younger,
    a computer allowed me to aspire towards a career in engineering. I would watch
    video of leaders who inspired me, such as Steve Jobs and Oprah Winfrey, as motivation.<br><br>I'm
    a recent graduate of UC Berkeley, where I pursued simultaneous Bachelor of Science
    degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Business Administration. I am interested
    in continued education in the future."
