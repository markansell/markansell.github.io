  content: "Hello! \U0001F44B Thanks for visiting my home on the internet.<br><br>I'm
    a mechanical engineer and new Program Manager at Microsoft Devices.<br><br>I'm
    interested in blending engineering, business, and public policy to create solutions
    to some of the world's most pressing problems, including climate change and economic
    stratification. Iâ€™m particularly interested in inspiring and preparing first-generation
    students to work in the tech industry.<br><br>Growing up, tech devices played
    a huge role in my life. They allowed me to access the internet, which exposed
    me to inspirational videos from leaders I admired such as Steve Jobs and Oprah
    Winfrey. This gave me the motivation to overcome tough challenges.<br><br>My perception
    of my place in the world first expanded when I overcame 10,000:1 odds to win the
    $50,000 Elks Most Valuable Student national scholarship in 2015. I remember feeling
    completely shocked, as I had not previously considered myself someone who could
    have an impact outside of my local community. I went on to attend UC Berkeley,
    fully intending on understanding how to build these devices that had such a positive
    impact on my life, so I could create these magical experiences for others.<br><br>Along
    the way, I have focused on creating opportunities for others to thrive. In high
    school, I led an anti-bullying upperclassmen-freshman mentorship program. At Cal,
    I co-founded <a href=\"/leadership\" title=\"Momentum\">Momentum</a> - the first
    student speaker series in the College of Engineering - with a goal of helping
    students gain career momentum. I currently run <a href=\"/leadership\" title=\"TheTechTwins\">TheTechTwins</a>,
    an informational YouTube channel to inspire and prepare students to work in the
    tech industry.<br><br>Originally from Los Angeles, CA, I attended UC Berkeley,
    where I earned simultaneous degrees in mechanical engineering and business administration.
    I studied abroad for 5 months at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland. I currently
    reside in the greater Seattle area and am deferring admission to Stanford GSB."
