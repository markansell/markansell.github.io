  content: "Hello! \U0001F44B Thanks for visiting my home on the internet. <br><br>\U0001F4CD
    Seattle, WA  ⬅️  Berkeley, CA  ⬅️ Glendale, CA<br><br>I'm Mark and I'm interested
    in building solutions to some of the world's most pressing problems. I've explored
    the intersection of engineering and business at UC Berkeley, hardware product
    development at Apple and Microsoft, and public speaking through a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/578SvV5zI68\"
    title=\"TEDx talk\">TEDx talk</a>.<br><br>I'm interested in innovative hardware
    product development because, when I was younger, a computer allowed me to aspire
    towards a career in engineering. Coming from a family of non-engineers and being
    first in my family to attend college in the U.S., I would watch videos of leaders
    who inspired me, such as Steve Jobs and Oprah Winfrey, as motivation.<br><br>Fostering
    an international perspective is important to me, as a child of two immigrants
    - my mom Armenian from Beirut, Lebanon and my dad a Kiwi from New Zealand. At
    Cal, I studied abroad for 5 months at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland. With
    Microsoft, I've travelled to China.<br><br>I also believe in integrating service
    into my life. In high school, I led an anti-bullying upperclassmen-freshman mentorship
    program; at Cal, I co-founded the <a href=\"engineering.berkeley.edu/momentum\"
    title=\"Momentum Speaker Series\">Momentum Speaker Series</a>; I currently run
    <a href=\"YouTube.com/TheTechTwins\" title=\"TheTechTwins\">TheTechTwins</a> to
    inspire and prepare students to work in the tech industry. <br><br>I'm a recent
    graduate of UC Berkeley, where I pursued simultaneous Bachelor of Science degrees
    in Mechanical Engineering and Business Administration. I am currently a Program
    Manager for the mechanical engineering development of a new Surface computer at
    Microsoft."
