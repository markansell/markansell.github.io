  content: "Hello! \U0001F44B Thanks for visiting my home on the internet. <br><br>I'm
    a mechanical engineer and new Program Manager at Microsoft Devices.<br><br>Originally
    from Los Angeles, CA, I attended UC Berkeley, where I earned simultaneous degrees
    in mechanical engineering and business administration. I'm currently part of a
    small cohort of students admitted (2-4 years) early to Stanford University's MBA
    program via deferred admission. I currently reside in the greater Seattle area.<br><br>I'm
    interested in blending engineering, business, and public policy to create solutions
    to some of the world's most pressing problems, including climate change and economic
    stratification.<br><br>Coming from an international family has instilled in me
    the importance of fostering a diverse perspective. My mom is Armenian from Beirut,
    Lebanon and my dad is a Kiwi from New Zealand. At Cal, I studied abroad for 5
    months at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland and explored much of Europe. With
    Microsoft, I've travelled to Asia.<br><br>Finally, I believe strongly in integrating
    service into my life. In high school, I led an anti-bullying upperclassmen-freshman
    mentorship program; at Cal, I co-founded the <a href=\"www.engineering.berkeley.edu/momentum\"
    title=\"Momentum Speaker Series\">Momentum Speaker Series</a>; I currently run
    <a href=\"www.YouTube.com/TheTechTwins\" title=\"TheTechTwins\">TheTechTwins</a>
    to inspire and prepare students to work in the tech industry."
